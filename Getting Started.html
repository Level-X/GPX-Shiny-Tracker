                <div class="body-small">
                    <ul class="GS">
                        <li>Step 1: Choosing a Text Editor.</li>
                        <p>Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac work just fine, but you can download a better editor
                            such as Atom, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.</p>
                        <li>Step 2: Updating the Pokémon you own.</li>
                        <p>Now that you have your text editor, open your Shiny Tracker of choice in the program. Once
                            you do that, you'll see something like this.</p>
                        <img class="GS2" src="Images/Getting Started/Screenshots/HTML-1.png">
                        <p>The only thing you need to worry about changing is the img class. By default, every img class
                            is marked as "notown". If you want to register as owned, change the img class to "own".</p>
                        <li>Step 3: Updating your total completion progress.</li>
                        <p>Close to the top of the HTML pages you'll find the "header". This is where you'll find your
                            collection progress of each Generation.</p>
                        <img class="GS2" src="Images/Getting Started/Screenshots/HTML-2.png">
                        <p>The two important codes are "value" and "title". The value visually raises your progress
                            percent, and the title tells you how many Shinies you own when you hover over the progress
                            bar. By default, every value is marked as "0" and the titles are marked as "0/#". #
                            represents the total number of Pokémon in the respective region. So, if you hatched a Shiny
                            Bulbasaur, you can set both 0's to 1.</p>
                        <li>Finished!: An example of the final result!</li>
                        <p>In this example, I marked that I owned all of the Pokémon in PC Box 1. I also changed the
                            appropriate commands for the progress bar so that it visually updates.</p>
                        <img class="GS" src="Images/Getting Started/Screenshots/HTML-3.png">
                        <p>As you can see, the Pokémon are now full color compared to the rest of the icons, and the
                            progress bar has been updated.<br>So now when I hover over the progress bar I get the
                            desired result!</p>

                        your browser cache.</p>
                    <p>With JavaScript, editing the tracker is simple. Just open your Shiny Tracker of choice in your
                        browser and click on the icons you own<br>to mark them as "owned". You can click the icon again
                        to mark it as "notown". The script updates the progress bar for you automatically.</p>
                    <hr>

                        <p>In this example I marked that I owned the entire Bulbasaur evolution line, this includes:
                            Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Mega Venusaur, and Gigantamax Venusaur. Now that I clicked
                            them on my browser their status has changed from "notown" to "own".</p>

                        <p>In order to replace this new data in our HTML file we will need to use the "Inspect" feature
                            that's built into our browser.<br>Right-click on empty space inside the Living Pokédex
                            section that contains all the Pokémon icons and then click "Inspect".</p>

                        <p>It will then bring up something like this at the bottom of your screen.</p>

                        <p>You'll see it highlighted over "div class body".<br>This is exactly what we intend, because

                        <li>Final Step: Copying the JavaScript changes</li>
                        <p>Right-click on this highlighted section > Copy > Outer HTML.</p>

                        Magneton, Magnezone or Magearna. But if you type "mage", you'll get right to Magearna! It's like
                        the search text always has a wildcard character on the end.</p>
                    <p>You do need to know a Pokémon's name, including form. By typing "altaria" you can get to Altaria
                        but also Altaria [Mega], since it has the same Pokédex number, so it's right nearby. But you
                        won't get to Altaria [Constellation], or Zhenyin, because they are listed under Novelty Pokémon
                        and not Generation III. You could find those two by typing "altaria [c", or just "zh".</p>

                    <p>While working on this project, I learned that the GPX+ Pokédex actually tells you which Pokémon
                        you own in your PC. Take a look at this:</p>
                    <img class="GS" src="Images/Getting Started/Screenshots/Pokédex.png">
                    <p>You see how on Bulbasaur's normal icon the background is light and on the shiny icon the
                        background is dark?<br>Well, the lighter background indicates that you do not currently own the
                        Pokémon, while the darker background indicates that you do.</p>

            <p class="GS">I made some buttons you can use to share both the GPX+ Discord server and the GPX+ Shiny
                Tracker. Feel free to use them in your forum signature if you choose!</p>
