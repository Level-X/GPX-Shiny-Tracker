                <section class="contentGS">
                    <li class="GS">Step 1: Choosing a Text Editor.</li>
                    <p class="GS2">Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac work just fine, but you can download a better
                        editor such as Atom, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.</p>
                    <li class="GS">Step 2: Updating the Pokémon you own.</li>
                    <p class="GS2">Now that you have the text editor of your choice, simply open either "GPX+ Shiny
                        Tracker" or "GPX+ Shiny Tracker Ultimate" in the program. Once you do that, you'll see something
                        like this.</p>
                    <img class="GS2" src="https://i.imgur.com/7ROC2d0.png" width="60%">
                    <p class="GS2">The only thing you need to worry about changing is the img class. By default, every
                        img class is marked as "notown". If you want to register as owned, change the img class to
                        "own".</p>
                    <li class="GS">Step 3: Updating your total completion progress.</li>
                    <p class="GS2">Under each region, there is a completion progress total that'll look something like
                        this.</p>
                    <img class="GS2" src="https://i.imgur.com/rjTZEij.png" width="60%">
                    <p class="GS2">The two important codes are "value" and "title". The value visually raises your
                        progress percent, and the title tells you how many Shinies you own when you hover over the
                        progress bar.<br>By default, every value is marked as "0" and the titles are marked as "0/#". #
                        represents the total number of Pokémon in the respective region. So, if you hatched a Shiny
                        Bulbasaur, you can set both 0's to 1.</p>
                    <li class="GS">Finished!: An example of the final result!</li>
                    <p class="GS2">In this example, I mark that I own: Mewtwo, Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mew. I
                        also changed the appropriate commands for the progress bar so that it visually updates.</p>
                    <img class="GS2" src="https://i.imgur.com/kCLpdVu.png" width="60%">
                    <p class="GS2">As you can see, the Pokémon are now full color compared to the rest of the icons, and
                        the progress bar has been updated, including the hover effect.</p>

                    <p class="GS">With JavaScript, editing the tracker is simple. Just open either "GPX+ Shiny Tracker"
                        or "GPX+ Shiny Tracker Ultimate" in your browser and click on the icons you own to mark them as
                        "owned".<br>You can click the icon again to mark it as "notown". The script updates the progress
                        bar for you automatically.</p>

                    <li class="GS">Step 1: Clicking the Pokémon icons you own.</li>
                    <p class="GS2">In this example I marked that I owned Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, and Venusaur.</p>

                    <li class="GS">Step 2: Inspect element</li>
                    <p class="GS2">Right-click on an empty space inside the Region section you are editing and then
                        click "Inspect".</p>
                    <img class="GS2" src="https://i.imgur.com/j5oqBQO.png" width="20%">
                    <p class="GS">It will then bring up something like this at the bottom of your screen.</p>
                    <img class="GS2" src="https://i.imgur.com/z17IVYj.png" width="60%">
                    <p class="GS2">You'll see it highlighted over "section id=Gen#" This is exactly what we intend. In
                        my case, it's "Gen1" because I'm using Kanto as my example.</p>
                    <li class="GS">Final Step: Copying the JavaScript changes</li>
                    <p class="GS2">Right-click on this highlighted section > Copy > Outer HTML.</p>
                    <img class="GS2" src="https://i.imgur.com/eO2ncJl.png" width="60%">
                    <p class="GS2">This copies from the start of the appropriate section to the end of it, including the
                        progress bar changes. From there, just paste over the exact code you copied in your HTML file
                        and save the changes.</p>

                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tifFoSb.png">
                    <li class="GS">What is the above icon used for?</li>
                    <p class="GS2">This is a placeholder image for future Pokémon to be introduced on GPX+. All
                        officially released Pokémon and forms in the main games will be added as placeholder images if
                        they're not already on the site,<br>although that doesn't necessarily mean that each one will be
                        added. For example, every Alcremie form I have listed may not be available. If this is the case,
                        then that specific placeholder image will be removed in a future update.</p>
                    <li class="GS">Are these all GPX+ icons?</li>
                    <p class="GS2">Yes, they are. I copied each one directly from the GPX+ Shiny Icon Sheet and placed
                        them on a 50x50 square, aligning them in the center. Some icons are cut off by default on GPX+
                        due to the limited PC Box space.<br>Due to transparency issues, I had to make minor changes to a
                        number of Pokémon, an example is Magikarp's whiskers.</p>
                    <li class="GS">How did you decide on the order of the Pokémon icons?</li>
                    <p class="GS2">Because the GPX+ Pokédex numbers are all over the place, and even though the creator
                        has mentioned before that it was a mess, I've tried to simplify things on this end.<br>As with
                        anything, there is no way to please everyone because you may like to organize things a bit
                        differently than I would. The official National Pokédex number takes first priority, with the
                        GPX+ Pokédex number<br>taking second. There are two exceptions to this in the novelty section:
                        Cherrim "Frost" because its icon uses the "Overcast" form as opposed to the "Sunshine"
                        form, and Missingno.<br>because it's a glitch from Generation 1, so technically it could be
                        considered #0.</p>

                <section class="contentGS">
                    <p class="GS">While working on this project, I learned that the GPX+ Pokédex actually tells you
                        which Pokémon you own in your PC. Take a look at this:</p>
                    <img class="GS2" src="https://i.imgur.com/7rOIOjk.png" width="60%">
                    <p class="GS2">You see how on Bulbasaur's normal icon the background is light and on the shiny icon
                        the background is dark? Well, the lighter background<br>indicates that you do not currently own
                        the Pokémon, while the darker background indicates that you do.</p>

            <p class="GS">I made some buttons you can use to share both the GPX+ Discord server and the GPX+ Shiny
                Tracker. Feel free to use them in your forum signature if you choose!</p>
