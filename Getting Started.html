                <summary>How do I edit the GPX+ Shiny Tracker with HTML?</summary>
                <section class="contentGS">
                    <ul class="GS">
                        <li>Step 1: Choosing a Text Editor.</li>
                        <p>Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac work just fine, but you can download a better editor
                            such as Atom, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.</p>
                        <li>Step 2: Updating the Pokémon you own.</li>
                        <p>Now that you have the text editor of your choice, simply open either "GPX+ Shiny Tracker" or
                            "GPX+ Shiny Tracker Ultimate" in the program. Once you do that, you'll see something like
                            this.</p>
                        <img class="GS" src="https://i.imgur.com/7ROC2d0.png" width="60%">
                        <p>The only thing you need to worry about changing is the img class. By default, every img class
                            is marked as "notown". If you want to register as owned, change the img class to "own".</p>
                        <li>Step 3: Updating your total completion progress.</li>
                        <p>Under each region, there is a completion progress total that'll look something like this.</p>
                        <img class="GS" src="https://i.imgur.com/rjTZEij.png" width="60%">
                        <p>The two important codes are "value" and "title". The value visually raises your progress
                            percent, and the title tells you how many Shinies you own when you hover over the progress
                            bar.<br>By default, every value is marked as "0" and the titles are marked as "0/#". #
                            represents the total number of Pokémon in the respective region. So, if you hatched a Shiny
                            Bulbasaur, you can set both 0's to 1.</p>
                        <li>Finished!: An example of the final result!</li>
                        <p>In this example, I mark that I own: Mewtwo, Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Mew. I also
                            changed the appropriate commands for the progress bar so that it visually updates.</p>
                        <img class="GS" src="https://i.imgur.com/kCLpdVu.png" width="60%">
                        <p>As you can see, the Pokémon are now full color compared to the rest of the icons, and the
                            progress bar has been updated, including the hover effect.</p>

                <summary>How do I edit the GPX+ Shiny Tracker with JavaScript?</summary>
                <section class="contentGS">
                    <p>Using this method stores your data in your browser. The data is removed if you clear your browser
                        cache.</p>
                    <p>With JavaScript, editing the tracker is simple. Just open either "GPX+ Shiny Tracker" or "GPX+
                        Shiny Tracker Ultimate" in your browser and click on the icons you own to mark them as
                        "owned".<br>You can click the icon again to mark it as "notown". The script updates the progress
                        bar for you automatically.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="GS">Let's backup your JavaScript changes to your HTML file!</p>
                    <ul class="GS">
                        <li>Step 1: Clicking the Pokémon icons you own.</li>
                        <p>In this example I marked that I owned Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, and Venusaur.</p>
                        <img class="GS" src="https://i.imgur.com/zAsVYq9.png" width="60%">
                        <li>Step 2: Inspect element</li>
                        <p>Right-click on an empty space inside the Region section you are editing and then click
                            "Inspect".</p>
                        <img class="GS" src="https://i.imgur.com/j5oqBQO.png" width="20%">
                        <p>It will then bring up something like this at the bottom of your screen.</p>
                        <img class="GS" src="https://i.imgur.com/z17IVYj.png" width="60%">
                        <p>You'll see it highlighted over "section id=Gen#" This is exactly what we intend. In my case,
                            it's "Gen1" because I'm using Kanto as my example.</p>

                        <li>Final Step: Copying the JavaScript changes</li>
                        <p>Right-click on this highlighted section > Copy > Outer HTML.</p>
                        <img class="GS" src="https://i.imgur.com/eO2ncJl.png" width="60%">
                        <p>This copies from the start of the appropriate section to the end of it, including the
                            progress bar changes. From there, just paste over the exact code you copied in your HTML
                            file and save the changes.</p>

                <section class="contentGS">
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tifFoSb.png">
                    <ul class="GS">
                        <li>What is the above icon used for?</li>
                        <p>This is a placeholder image for future Pokémon to be introduced on GPX+. All officially
                            released Pokémon and forms in the main games will be added as placeholder images<br>if
                            they're not already on the site, although that doesn't necessarily mean that each one will
                            be added. For example, every Alcremie form I have listed may not be available.<br>If this is
                            the case, then that specific placeholder image will be removed in a future update.</p>
                        <li>Are these all GPX+ icons?</li>
                        <p>Yes, they are. I copied each one directly from the GPX+ Shiny Icon Sheet and placed them on a
                            50x50 square, aligning them in the center.<br>Some icons are cut off by default on GPX+ due
                            to the limited PC Box space.<br>Due to transparency issues, I had to make minor changes to a
                            number of Pokémon, an example is Magikarp's whiskers.</p>
                        <li>How did you decide on the order of the Pokémon icons?</li>
                        <p>Because the GPX+ Pokédex numbers are all over the place, and even though thecreator has
                            mentioned before that it was a mess, I've tried to simplify things on this end.<br>As with
                            anything, there is no way to please everyone because you may like to organize things a bit
                            differently than I would. The official National Pokédex number<br>takes first priority, with
                            the GPX+ Pokédex number taking second. There are two exceptions to this in the novelty
                            section: Cherrim "Frost" because its icon<br>uses the "Overcast" form as opposed to the
                            "Sunshine" form, and Missingno. because it's a glitch from Generation 1, so technically it
                            could be considered #0.</p>

                <section class="contentGS">
                    <p>While working on this project, I learned that the GPX+ Pokédex actually tells you which Pokémon
                        you own in your PC. Take a look at this:</p>
                    <img class="GS" src="https://i.imgur.com/7rOIOjk.png" width="60%">
                    <p>You see how on Bulbasaur's normal icon the background is light and on the shiny icon the
                        background is dark? Well, the lighter background<br>indicates that you do not currently own the
                        Pokémon, while the darker background indicates that you do.</p>

                I made some buttons you can use to share both the GPX+ Discord server and the GPX+ Shiny Tracker. Feel
                free to use them in your forum signature if you choose!
